# Enhanced-Pong-Python
A Python game I coded to teach 7th graders how to code. The game was completed in only 4 days of coding where the kids I taught would take ideas from games they played or ideas they had and I tried to code them into the Pong game. The game is a result of 8 kids ideas over 4 days of coding.
